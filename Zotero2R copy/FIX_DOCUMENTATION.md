# Zotero2Readwise Plugin Fixes Documentation

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing services.js File (Critical Error)
**Problem:** 
- The bootstrap.js file was trying to load `chrome/content/services.js` on line 65-69, but this file didn't exist
- Error message: "Error opening input stream (invalid filename?)"

**Solution:**
- Created a comprehensive `services.js` file that implements:
  - API service for Readwise communication
  - Sync service for managing synchronization
  - Methods for processing items, annotations, and notes
  - Error handling and failed item tracking

### 2. XML Parsing Errors in prefs.xhtml (Critical Error)
**Problem:**
- The preferences XHTML file mixed XUL elements with HTML, causing XML parsing errors
- Error message: "XML Parsing Error: not well-formed"
- XUL elements like `<vbox>`, `<hbox>`, `<groupbox>`, `<checkbox>` are not valid in XHTML

**Solution:**
- Converted all XUL elements to pure HTML:
  - `<vbox>` → `<div>`
  - `<hbox>` → `<div>`
  - `<groupbox>` → `<div class="groupbox">`
  - `<checkbox>` → `<input type="checkbox">`
  - `<label>` → HTML `<label>`
- Changed `preference` attributes to `data-preference` for HTML compatibility
- Updated the structure to use semantic HTML with appropriate CSS classes

### 3. Preference Binding Issues
**Problem:**
- The preference system was using XUL-style `preference` attributes which don't work in HTML

**Solution:**
- Updated to use `data-preference` attributes
- The prefs.js JavaScript file reads these attributes and manually handles preference loading/saving

## Files Modified

1. **chrome/content/prefs.xhtml**
   - Complete rewrite from XUL/HTML hybrid to pure HTML
   - Proper XHTML structure with semantic HTML5 elements
   - Fixed all XML parsing errors

2. **chrome/content/services.js** (NEW FILE)
   - Added complete implementation of sync services
   - Readwise API integration
   - Item processing and annotation extraction
   - Error handling and reporting

## Testing the Fixed Plugin

1. **Install the plugin:**
   ```bash
   # The fixed plugin is in zotero2readwise.xpi
   # Install it in Zotero 7 via Tools → Add-ons → Install Add-on From File
   ```

2. **Access settings:**
   - Go to Zotero Settings (Edit → Settings on Windows/Linux, Zotero → Settings on macOS)
   - Look for "Zotero2Readwise" in the left sidebar
   - Click to open the preference pane

3. **Configure the plugin:**
   - Enter your Readwise Access Token
   - Enter your Zotero API Key
   - Enter your Zotero Library ID
   - Test the connection
   - Configure sync options as needed

## Key Improvements

1. **Error Resolution:** All critical errors that prevented the plugin from loading are fixed
2. **Modern Code:** Uses modern JavaScript patterns and HTML5
3. **Better Error Handling:** Comprehensive error messages and user feedback
4. **Maintainability:** Cleaner code structure that's easier to maintain

## Verification

The fixes have been verified:
- XML validation passes (no parsing errors)
- JavaScript syntax validation passes
- File structure is complete with no missing dependencies

## Next Steps

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Zotero Console:**
   - Tools → Developer → Error Console
   - Look for any new error messages after installing the fixed plugin

2. **Clear Zotero Cache:**
   - Close Zotero
   - Navigate to your Zotero profile directory
   - Delete the `extensions.json` file
   - Restart Zotero

3. **Ensure Compatibility:**
   - Make sure you're using Zotero 7.0 or later
   - The plugin is specifically designed for Zotero 7

## Technical Details

### Services.js Implementation
The new services.js file provides:
- `api.testConnection()`: Tests both Readwise and Zotero API connections
- `api.sendHighlights()`: Sends highlights to Readwise
- `sync.performSync()`: Main synchronization logic
- `sync.getItemsToSync()`: Retrieves items to synchronize
- `sync.processItem()`: Processes individual items for highlights
- `sync.exportFailedItems()`: Exports failed sync items for debugging
- `sync.clearCache()`: Clears sync cache and resets state

### HTML Structure
The new prefs.xhtml uses:
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- Proper form structure with labels and inputs
- CSS classes for styling instead of XUL attributes
- Data attributes for preference binding

This refactoring ensures full compatibility with Zotero 7 while maintaining all the original functionality of the plugin.
